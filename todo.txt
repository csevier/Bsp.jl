Data / Assets
=============
1. Improve pwad patching support
    - patching is botched at the moment.
3. Make sky texture more identifiable, possibly with mapinfo?
4. Support pk3?

Rendering
==========
1. Not all texture offsets are correct leading to busted textures (The textures appear to be shifting positive x with more distance
2. Need to draw masked: sprites, transparent walls etc
3. Diminished lighting via color maps!
4. Texture Animation
5. Sprite Animation
6. Sprite Angles from player view
8. Consider moving to visplanes over flat columns?
10. Color effects via pallets
11. Every single freedoom1, freedoom2, freedm, blasphamerer and blasdm map has to render without error.
    - I think ive done it. playtest playtest playtest!
